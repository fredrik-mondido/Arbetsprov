# The Most Epic To-Do List in the World

Brought to you by Seth NeJame. . .this project is currently a work in progress. The aim of the project is to create a task list a la JS/React to display my coding prowess and ingenuity. It is to be completed in conjunction with the tech specs set below.

Stay tuned for more updates.

## Deployment

Deployment of the aforementioned app will be to my GH-Pages App once work on the app has been completed. I will also have an open PR with the original branch (belonging to fredrik-mondido) where you can view my progress.

My forked repo can be found here:

# Welcome to Mondido

Congratulations on making it this far. Beyond this point lies work satisfaction and great colleagues, but first, you must prove yourself in one last feat of coding prowess to prove your worth. Beyond this brief introductory text lies a somewhat lacking specification to a problem we want you to solve. Mind, the specification was created by a team of management consultants, sold by a dedicated and customer-pleasing team of salespersons lacking in nothing but their total disregard of realistic deadlines and developer frustration levels, to a customer now chomping at the bit to release the feature to thousands of customers. Failure is not an option, and it is up to you to ship this feature and save the world by doing so.

## The task

I want you to build a task tracking application. It is up to you to add any feature that you might enhance this simple application and staple of programming lore. In the words of the regional sales manager,it is my job to overpromise, and it is your duty to over deliver. There are, however, a few requirements for you to follow. See below for instructions.

## Specification

Below is the basic layout of the application we want you to create.

### Minimum functionality

Create, display, complete, update, assign and delete tasks.

### Story points

Each task should have an assigned complexity index from 0-10

### States

A task can have the following states:
created, active, completed, onhold and deleted.

The status can only be changed according to the following rules.

- A task can only be completed after being set to active.
- A task can only become active after being assigned a dev
- A task can only go from onhold to active or deleted

### Basic layout

The tasks should be presented in columns representing the available states. Deleted tasks should not be presented in a column but rather have a separate view. It should be possible to sort the tasks in a column according to level of complexity, see story points.

### UI/UX

The designer is on vacation, it is up to you to imagine and construct a neat and customer facing interface.

## Requirements

All logic must reside in a single HOC component. Use Hooks. All components must be functional components. The application must be deterministic. All components other than the HOC component housing the logic must be stateless at all times. Use Jest to test your components. GIT is to be used at all times, it is essential that we can follow your development process through your commits.

## Focus

Performance, performance, performance and more performance. Keep it simple, keep it smart, make it fast, make it fun and for [insert deity of choice] don't use libraries.

## Extra credit

Surprise us.

## Gold star

Make us laugh.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
